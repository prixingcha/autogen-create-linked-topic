Context is: abilities and collectively arrive at better solutions. (A1, A2, A3, and A4). Analogously, in certain
scenarios, some agents are required to work in an adversarial way. Relevant information is shared
among different conversations in a controlled manner, preventing distraction or hallucination. (A4,
A6). AutoGen supports both patterns, enabling effective utilization and augmentation of LLMs.
B.1 General Guidelines for Using AutoGen
Below we give some recommendations for using agents in AutoGen to accomplish a task.
1.Consider using built-in agents first. For example, AssistantAgent is pre-configured to be
backed by GPT-4, with a carefully designed system message for generic problem-solving via
code. The UserProxyAgent is configured to solicit human inputs and perform tool execution.
Many problems can be solved by simply combining these two agents. When customizing agents
for an application, consider the following options: (1) human input mode, termination condition,
code execution configuration, and LLM configuration can be specified when constructing an
agent; (2) AutoGen supports adding instructions in an initial user message, which is an effective
way to boost performance without needing to modify the system message; (3) UserProxyAgent
can be extended to handle different execution environments and exceptions, etc.; (4) when sys-
tem message modification is needed, consider leveraging the LLM’s capability to program its
conversation flow with natural language.
2.Start with a simple conversation topology . Consider using the two-agent chat or the group chat
setup first, as they can often be extended with the least code. Note that the two-agent chat can
be easily extended to involve more than two agents by using LLM-consumable functions in a
dynamic way.
3. Try to reuse built-in reply methods based on LLM, tool, or human before implementing a
custom reply method because they can often be reused to achieve the goal in a simple way
(e.g., the built-in agent GroupChatManager ’s reply method reuses the built-in LLM-based reply
function when selecting the next speaker, ref. A5 in Section 3).
4. When developing a new application with UserProxyAgent ,start with humans always in
the loop , i.e., human input mode=‘ALWAYS’, even if the target operation mode is more au-
tonomous. This helps evaluate the effectiveness of AssistantAgent , tuning the prompt, dis-
covering corner cases, and debugging. Once confident with small-scale success, consider setting
16human input mode = ‘NEVER’. This enables LLM as a backend, and one can either use the
LLM or manually generate diverse system messages to simulate different use cases.
5. Despite the numerous advantages of AutoGen agents, there could be cases/scenarios where other
libraries/packages could help . For example: (1) For (sub)tasks that do not have requirements
for back-and-forth trouble-shooting, multi-agent interaction, etc., a unidirectional (no back-and-
forth message exchange) pipeline can also be orchestrated with LangChain (LangChain, 2023),
LlamaIndex (Liu, 2022), Guidance (Guidance, 2023), Semantic Kernel (Semantic-Kernel, 2023),
Gorilla (Patil et al., 2023) or low-level inference API (‘autogen.oai’ provides an enhanced LLM
inference layer at this level) (Dibia, 2023). (2) When existing tools from LangChain etc. are
helpful, one can use them as tool backends for AutoGen agents. For example, one can readily use
tools, e.g., Wolfram Alpha, from LangChain in AutoGen agent. (3) For specific applications, one
may want to leverage agents implemented in other libraries/packages. To achieve this, one could
wrap those agents as conversable agents in AutoGen and then use them to build LLM applications
through multi-agent conversation. (4) It can be hard to find an optimal operating point among
many tunable choices, such as the LLM inference configuration. Blackbox optimization packages
like ‘flaml.tune’ (Wang et al., 2021) can be used together with AutoGen to automate such tuning.
B.2 Future Work
This work raises many research questions and future directions and .
Designing optimal multi-agent workflows: Creating a multi-agent workflow for a given task can
involve many decisions, e.g., how many agents to include, how to assign agent roles and agent
capabilities, how the agents should interact with each other, and whether to automate a particular
part of the workflow. There may not exist a one-fits-all answer, and the best solution might depend
on the specific application. This raises important questions: For what types of tasks and applications
are multi-agent workflows most useful? How do multiple agents help in different applications? For
ing the development of high-performance multi-agent applications. These applications are selected
based on their real-world relevance (A1, A2, A4, A5, A6), problem difficulty and solving capabil-
ities enabled by AutoGen (A1, A2, A3, A4), and innovative potential (A5, A6). Together, these
criteria showcase AutoGen ’s role in advancing the LLM-application landscape.

A1: Math Problem Solving
Mathematics is a foundational discipline and the promise of leveraging LLMs to assist with math
problem solving opens up a new plethora of applications and avenues for exploration, including per-
sonalized AI tutoring, AI research assistance, etc. This section demonstrates how AutoGen can help
develop LLM applications for math problem solving, showcasing strong performance and flexibility
in supporting various problem-solving paradigms.
(Scenario 1 ) We are able to build a system for autonomous math problem solving by directly reusing
two built-in agents from AutoGen . We evaluate our system and several alternative approaches,
including open-source methods such as Multi-Agent Debate (Liang et al., 2023), LangChain Re-
Act (LangChain, 2023), vanilla GPT-4, and commercial products ChatGPT + Code Interpreter, and
ChatGPT + Plugin (Wolfram Alpha), on the MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021) dataset and summarize
the results in Figure 4a. We perform evaluations over 120 randomly selected level-5 problems and
on the entire5test dataset from MATH. The results show that the built-in agents from AutoGen al-
ready yield better performance out of the box compared to the alternative approaches, even including
the commercial ones. ( Scenario 2 ) We also showcase a human-in-the-loop problem-solving process
with the help of AutoGen . To incorporate human feedback with AutoGen , one only needs to set
human input mode=‘ALWAYS’ in the UserProxyAgent of the system in scenario 1. We demon-
strate that this system can effectively incorporate human inputs to solve challenging problems that
cannot be solved without humans. ( Scenario 3 ) We further demonstrate a novel scenario where
multiple human users can participate in the conversations during the problem-solving process. Our
experiments and case studies for these scenarios show that AutoGen enables better performance or
new experience compared to other solutions we experimented with. Due to the page limit, details of
the evaluation, including case studies in three scenarios are in Appendix D.
A2: Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation and Question Answering
Retrieval augmentation has emerged as a practical and effective approach for mitigating the intrinsic
limitations of LLMs by incorporating external documents. In this section, we employ AutoGen to
build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system (Lewis et al., 2020; Parvez et al., 2021)
named Retrieval-augmented Chat. The system consists of two agents: a Retrieval-augmented User
Proxy agent and a Retrieval-augmented Assistant agent, both of which are extended from built-in
agents from AutoGen . The Retrieval-augmented User Proxy includes a vector database (Chroma,

stricted by its hourly message-number limitation. Multi-agent debate and LangChain ReAct were also not
evaluated since they underperformed vanilla GPT-4 on the smaller test set.

multi-agent collaboration? (2) How can we develop a straightforward, unified interface that can
accommodate a wide range of agent conversation patterns? In practice, applications of varying
complexities may need distinct sets of agents with specific capabilities, and may require different
conversation patterns, such as single- or multi-turn dialogs, different human involvement modes, and
static vs. dynamic conversation. Moreover, developers may prefer the flexibility to program agent
interactions in natural language or code. Failing to adequately address these two questions would
limit the framework’s scope of applicability and generality.
While there is contemporaneous exploration of multi-agent approaches,3we present AutoGen , a
generalized multi-agent conversation framework (Figure 1), based on the following new concepts.
1Customizable and conversable agents. AutoGen uses a generic design of agents that can lever-
age LLMs, human inputs, tools, or a combination of them. The result is that developers can
easily and quickly create agents with different roles (e.g., agents to write code, execute code,
wire in human feedback, validate outputs, etc.) by selecting and configuring a subset of built-in
capabilities. The agent’s backend can also be readily extended to allow more custom behaviors.
To make these agents suitable for multi-agent conversation, every agent is made conversable –
they can receive, react, and respond to messages. When configured properly, an agent can hold
multiple turns of conversations with other agents autonomously or solicit human inputs at cer-
tain rounds, enabling human agency and automation. The conversable agent design leverages the
strong capability of the most advanced LLMs in taking feedback and making progress via chat
and also allows combining capabilities of LLMs in a modular fashion. (Section 2.1)
2Conversation programming. A fundamental insight of AutoGen is to simplify and unify com-
plex LLM application workflows as multi-agent conversations. So AutoGen adopts a program-
ming paradigm centered around these inter-agent conversations. We refer to this paradigm as
conversation programming , which streamlines the development of intricate applications via two
primary steps: (1) defining a set of conversable agents with specific capabilities and roles (as
described above); (2) programming the interaction behavior between agents via conversation-
centric computation andcontrol . Both steps can be achieved via a fusion of natural and pro-
gramming languages to build applications with a wide range of conversation patterns and agent
behaviors. AutoGen provides ready-to-use implementations and also allows easy extension and
experimentation for both steps. (Section 2.2)
3We refer to Appendix A for a detailed discussion.
2AutoGen also provides a collection of multi-agent applications created using conversable agents
and conversation programming. These applications demonstrate how AutoGen can easily support
applications of various complexities and LLMs of various capabilities. Moreover, we perform both
evaluation on benchmarks and a pilot study of new applications. The results show that AutoGen can
help achieve outstanding performance on many tasks, and enable innovative ways of using LLMs,
while reducing development effort. (Section 3 and Appendix D)
2 The AutoGen Framework
To reduce the effort required for developers to create complex LLM applications across various do-
mains, a core design principle of AutoGen is to streamline and consolidate multi-agent workflows
using multi-agent conversations. This approach also aims to maximize the reusability of imple-
mented agents. This section introduces the two key concepts of AutoGen : conversable agents and
conversation programming.
2.1 Conversable Agents
InAutoGen , aconversable agent is an entity with a specific role that can pass messages to send and
receive information to and from other conversable agents, e.g., to start or continue a conversation. It
maintains its internal context based on sent and received messages and can be configured to possess
a set of capabilities, e.g., enabled by LLMs, tools, or human input, etc. The agents can act according
to programmed behavior patterns described next.
Agent capabilities powered by LLMs, humans, and tools. Since an agent’s capabilities directly
influence how it processes and responds to messages, AutoGen allows flexibility to endow its agents
with various capabilities. AutoGen supports many common composable capabilities for agents,
including 1) LLMs. LLM-backed agents exploit many capabilities of advanced LLMs such as role
playing, implicit state inference and progress making conditioned on conversation history, providing
feedback, adapting from feedback, and coding. These capabilities can be combined in different ways
via novel prompting techniques4to increase an agent’s skill and autonomy. AutoGen also offers
enhanced LLM inference features such as result caching, error handling, message templating, etc.,
via an enhanced LLM inference layer. 2) Humans. Human involvement is desired or even essential
in many LLM applications. AutoGen lets a human participate in agent conversation via human-
